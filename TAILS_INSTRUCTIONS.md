# Running slip39-backup on Tails

The tool ships as a single AppImage that opens a **native window**: no browser,
no local server, no Tor configuration. All cryptography runs locally; the window
is rendered by WebKitGTK, which Tails ships out of the box.

The app has two pages you'll use:
- **`/owner`**: create a backup. Saves one zip named after the wallet and the
  date, for example `slip39-wallet-backup-main-wallet-2026-08-13.zip`, holding
  the share zips, the single ciphertext `payload/payload.age.gpg.asc`, a
  verification record and the recovery documents.
- **`/recoverer`**: recover a wallet. Drop in threshold-many share zips and
  `payload.age.gpg.asc` (or paste its text), then click Recover. Older backups
  may hold `payload.age` or `payload.age.txt` instead, and those still work.

**The ciphertext has two locks, both opened by the same key.** age on the inside,
OpenPGP AES-256 on the outside, and your shares rebuild the one key that opens
both. One file ships rather than one per layer: an unwrapped copy sitting beside
the wrapped one would let anyone who found the folder break the weaker of the two
and ignore the other.

## Requirements

- **Tails 7.0 or later** (Debian 13 base). Tails 6 and older are end-of-life
  and unsupported: on them the app fails to start with a `GLIBC_2.38 not
  found` error. Check your version under Applications, Tails, About Tails.
- A USB drive with the AppImage (and its `.sha256`, if you downloaded it from GitHub
  Releases). The filename carries the version, for example
  `slip39-backup-2.0.0-x86_64.AppImage`. Substitute the version you downloaded in the
  commands below; the app shows the same number in its footer, so you can check the
  file you ran is the file you meant to run.

## Steps

1. **Boot Tails.** For real backups, do **not** connect to a network. The whole
   point is generating secrets on an airgapped machine, and the tool detects
   connectivity and watermarks anything generated while online as INSECURE-TEST.

2. **Copy the AppImage** from the USB into the home folder (`/home/amnesia`).
   Running from the home folder avoids filesystem quirks of FAT-formatted
   sticks (where the executable bit can't be set).

3. **Verify the download** (only needed if the file came from GitHub rather
   than your own build):
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c slip39-backup-2.0.0-x86_64.AppImage.sha256
   ```

4. **Run it** (in Files, right-click the folder and choose Open Terminal Here):
   ```bash
   chmod +x slip39-backup-2.0.0-x86_64.AppImage
   ./slip39-backup-2.0.0-x86_64.AppImage
   ```
   The app window opens directly. (Double-clicking in the Files app does
   nothing: GNOME deliberately refuses to launch raw executables, so the
   terminal is the supported path.)

5. **Create your backup** in the Owner page. Save the output where you choose
   via the native save dialog; print the recovery kit via the print dialog
   (print-to-PDF works out of the box).

6. **Shut down Tails.** Everything outside your explicit saves is wiped on a
   default (non-Persistent) session. The app itself never writes your seed or
   passphrase to disk unless you save it yourself; the WebKitGTK window does
   create its own small local-data folder, the way any browser engine does,
   holding no wallet data, and it is wiped along with the rest unless you have
   enabled Persistent Storage, in which case it is not.

## Troubleshooting

- **`GLIBC_2.38 not found`**: your Tails is version 6 or older. Upgrade the
  stick to Tails 7 or later (going from 6 to 7 needs a fresh install with Tails
  Cloner, not the automatic upgrader).
- **`Permission denied` when running**: the file is on a FAT-formatted stick
  where `chmod +x` silently does nothing. Copy it to the home folder first.
- **Window doesn't open, webkit errors in terminal**: you're not on Tails
  (the AppImage deliberately relies on Tails's system WebKitGTK; other distros
  need `libwebkit2gtk-4.1` installed).
